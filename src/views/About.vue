        <strong> BBS </strong>
        is an important platform for academic discussion, where researchers are able to raise their questions and express their views online.
        Such softwares includes, campus based BBS, zhihu, reddit, quora, <i>etc</i>.
        However, these BBS do not purely focus on academic research, and its design is therefore not specific for academic purpose.
        In this sense, AcademicDealer is specialized for academic use and has corresponding designs to serve better.
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: Times, serif; line-height:150%">
        <strong> Research Gate </strong>
        is a better option currently for academic usage than BBS, because it is specially designed for scientific research.
        The main functions in Research Gate contains announcing a published paper, updating a going-on project and having online discussions.
        Although Research Gate succeeds in serving researchers in various aspects, it encounters difficulty when entering physical world.
        It is such a world-wide software means the users are difficult to call on off-line activities via Research Gate, which are more valuable than online activities in research.
        To this end, AcademicDealer is just like the most awesome merchant in local market, where he blends into local environment and offers advice and opportunities for off-line activities, such as seminars and lectures.
